<h2> 1. Version Control System </h2>

- To manage the change of the code by recording the version of each point on the same purpose of data
- Record each information separately by giving a version number for each change

**Why do we use VSC?**

- Track changes through the context of the current code
- Identify who has modified the source code
- Provides the ability to revert to a previous version in case of any issue
- Perform backup for codes
- Synchronize code while working together / Prevent code collisions and loss
- Documentation only with its history

<h2> 2. VCS Type </h2>

**Original Version Control**

- Save seperately after copying files

**LVCS (Local Version Control System)**

- Manage versions individually: Difficult to collaborate and all history is lost if the person's data goes wrong.

**CVCS (Central Version Control System)**
 
- Manage storing multiple clients' files in one server
- Largely afftected by central server
- Typically CVS / SVN

**DVCS (Distributed Version Control System)**

- Have both local and remote repository separately. Can have multiple remote repositories.
- Have powerful branch merging function compared to the original VCS, and not dependent on the central server
- Typically Git / Mercurial
