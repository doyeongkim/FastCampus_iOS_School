<h1> Conditional Statements </h1>

<h2> if Statements </h2>

An if statement is used for executing code based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.

There are 2 basic forms of an if statement where each form needs to have the opening and closing braces. 

The first form - allows code to be executed only when a condition is true and has the following form: 

```swift
 if #condition# {
   #code#
 }
 ```
