<H2> 1. Program VS Process </H2>

The major difference between these two is "program" is a group of instructions to carry out a specified task, whereas the "process" is a program in execution. The program is a definite group of ordered operations that are to be performed. On the other hand, an instance of a program being executed is a process. A program is considered to be a passive, since it does nothing until it gets executed, while a process is an active entity as it is an instance of executing program and perform the specific action. The resource requirement is much higher in case of process; it could need CPU, memory address, I/O resources for successful execution. However, a program just needs memory for storage.
