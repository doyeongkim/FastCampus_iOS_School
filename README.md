<H1> Lesson 1 - Computer Introduction </H1>

<H2> 1. Program VS Process </H2>

The major difference between these two is "program" is a group of instructions to carry out a specified task, whereas the "process" is a program in execution. The program is a definite group of ordered operations that are to be performed. On the other hand, an instance of a program being executed is a process. A program is considered to be a passive, since it does nothing until it gets executed, while a process is an active entity as it is an instance of executing program and perform the specific action. The resource requirement is much higher in case of process; it could need CPU, memory address, I/O resources for successful execution. However, a program just needs memory for storage.

<H2> 2. Memory </H2>

**Memory Hierarchy**

**How CPU (Central Processing Unit) Works**

Components | Roles
---------- |------
ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) | Executes all arithmetic and logical operations
CU (Control Unit) | Decodes the instruction (send data to ALU to execute arithmetic and logical instructions)
CPU register | Temporary storage for instructions or data
Bus interface | receive or send data from other devices





The control unit fetches (gets) the instruction from memory.
The control unit decodes the instruction (decides what it means) and directs that the necessary data be moved from memory to the arithmetic/logic unit.

Registers are temporary storage areas for instructions or data. They are not a part of memory; rather they are special additional storage locations that offer the advantage of speed. Registers work under the direction of the control unit to accept, hold, and transfer instructions or data and perform arithmetic or logical comparisons at high speed. The control unit uses a data storage register the way a store owner uses a cash register-as a temporary, convenient place to store what is used in transactions.
